# Decided Applications
The purpose of this script is to fetch Moreland Council Planning Applications that the council has made a decision in.

This script complements the [Planning Alerts service for Moreland](https://www.planningalerts.org.au/authorities/moreland_city), which only scrapes new applications, not those which have been ruled on.
